For example, in a model that recommends whether an individual be given a loan or not, a good explanation must be able to tell *what factors should/could I change to alter the model prediction*.\n",
    "2. **Selective** - We *humans are only capable to comprehend 2 to 3 variables at a time*. Thus, a good model explanation must be able to *list the important drivers to explain an outcome*. Imagine having an interpretable model such as linear regression or decision trees, but an explanation that looks at hundreds or thousands of variables, it would be really hard for any human to digest that explanation!\n",
    "3. **Consistent with prior beliefs** - Model explanations are greatly affected by how people perceived them. As such, when *an explanation is consistent with the prior beliefs of an individual*, they tend to favor such explanation ( also known as **confirmation bias**). This is not to discredit any novel or serendipitous discoveries of the model explanation. However, having an explanation that is in line with a domain expert, helps in the model's adoption.
